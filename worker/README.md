# Proxy Workers

This folder has two small Cloudflare Workers. Both exist for the same reason: the site each
one talks to sends no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, so a browser blocks the tool's
`fetch()` from reading the response directly. Each Worker fetches the real site server-side
(no CORS restriction between servers) and returns the result with CORS enabled, so the tool
can call the Worker instead.

| Worker | Talks to | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `ldt-proxy.js` | NY State Wadsworth Center CLEP LDT database | The **LDT** search tab |
| `fda-pdf-proxy.js` | accessdata.fda.gov (510(k) Decision Summary PDFs) | "Check Measurand" on an FDA search result |

Both are optional — the FDA 510(k) search tab works with neither of them deployed. Deploy
whichever feature you want to use; skip the other if you don't need it.

## Deploy (no local Node/wrangler needed)

This takes about 5 minutes per Worker, entirely in the browser, on Cloudflare's free plan (no
credit card required). Cloudflare's dashboard wording shifts slightly between account types
and over time — if a button doesn't say the exact text below, look for the button that
matches the *description* next to it; the flow itself is stable. Repeat these steps once for
each Worker you want (they're independent — different name, different code, different URL).

**1. Create a Cloudflare account (skip if you already have one)**

Go to **[dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)** and sign up with
an email address. No payment info is needed for what we're doing here.

**2. Open the Workers section**

Log in at **[dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com)**. In the left sidebar, click
**Workers & Pages** (if you don't see a sidebar, click the hamburger/menu icon top-left first).

**3. Pick a `workers.dev` subdomain (first Worker only, one-time)**

If this is the very first Worker on your account, Cloudflare will ask you to choose a
subdomain, e.g. typing `francis-tools` gives you `*.francis-tools.workers.dev` for every
Worker you ever create. Pick anything available and confirm — you can't easily change this
later, but it doesn't matter what you pick. Skip this step if you've already deployed one
Worker before (e.g. you're now adding the second one).

**4. Create the Worker**

Click **Create application** (or just **Create**, depending on what you see) → choose
**Create Worker** (sometimes labeled **"Hello World" Worker** or similar — you want the
plain/blank starter, not a framework template like Next.js or a specific gallery example).
Give it a name when prompted — e.g. `ldt-proxy` or `fda-pdf-proxy` (this becomes part of the
URL, so keep it short — the boxes usually accept `-` but not spaces). Click **Deploy** to
create it with its placeholder "Hello World" code — you'll replace that code next.

**5. Replace the code**

On the Worker's page, click **Edit code** (sometimes shown as a `</>` icon, or "Edit" in a
dropdown). This opens a browser-based code editor showing a file, usually named `worker.js`
or `index.js`, containing placeholder `Hello World` code.

- Select **all** the existing text in that file (Ctrl+A / Cmd+A) and delete it.
- Open the file you want from this repo — [`ldt-proxy.js`](ldt-proxy.js) or
  [`fda-pdf-proxy.js`](fda-pdf-proxy.js) — copy its **entire contents**, and paste it into the
  editor in place of the placeholder.

**6. Deploy**

Click **Save and deploy** (or **Deploy**, top-right of the editor). Wait for the confirmation
that it deployed successfully.

**7. Get the URL and verify it works**

Go back to the Worker's main page (leave the code editor) — you'll see its URL near the top,
looking like:

```
https://ldt-proxy.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev
```
or
```
https://fda-pdf-proxy.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev
```

Test it directly in a new browser tab before wiring it into the tool:

- **LDT proxy**: append `?q=GADA` — you should see a page of JSON starting with
  `{"term":"GADA","total":...`.
- **FDA PDF proxy**: append `?k=K051061` — your browser should open/download an actual PDF
  (a real Decision Summary). If you see JSON like `{"error":...}` instead, read the message —
  `Missing or malformed required query parameter: k` just means you forgot `?k=...`.

If instead you see an error page or blank response, see **Troubleshooting** below.

**8. Wire it into the tool**

Open `FDA510kBiomarkerSearch.html` in a browser, click the gear icon (Settings), and paste the
Worker's base URL (**without** the `?q=...`/`?k=...` part you added to test) into the matching
field — **LDT proxy Worker URL** or **FDA PDF proxy Worker URL**. Then either switch to the
**LDT** tab and search a biomarker, or run an FDA search and click **Check Measurand** on a
result, to confirm.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Step 7's test URL shows Cloudflare's default "Hello World" text, not JSON/a PDF | The code paste in step 5 didn't fully replace the placeholder, or you deployed before saving the paste. Go back to **Edit code**, confirm the file starts with the matching Worker's opening comment (`// LDT search proxy for...` or `// Generic byte-relay proxy for FDA...`), then deploy again. |
| LDT test URL shows `{"error":"Missing required query parameter: q"}` | Working correctly — you forgot to add `?q=GADA` (or similar) to the end of the URL. |
| LDT test URL shows `{"error":"LDT lookup failed", ...}` | The Worker deployed fine but couldn't reach or parse wadsworth.org — check the `detail` field; a timeout usually just means retry, since wadsworth.org can be slow. |
| FDA PDF test URL shows `{"error":"No Decision Summary available for this K number",...}` | Working correctly — not every device has one (this is common for older/simpler submissions). Try a different K number. |
| FDA PDF test URL shows `{"error":"Upstream did not return a PDF (possibly rate-limited)...`" | accessdata.fda.gov has aggressive bot detection and occasionally blocks rapid requests — wait a bit and retry. |
| The tool shows "Network error — could not reach the LDT proxy" / "Add an FDA PDF proxy Worker URL..." | The URL pasted into Settings is wrong, missing, or empty — re-check it matches exactly what step 7 showed (no trailing `?q=...`/`?k=...`, no trailing slash). |
| Can't find "Create Worker" / only see Pages options | You may be in the **Pages** tab instead of **Workers** — look for a toggle or separate tab between "Workers" and "Pages" near the top of the section. |

## `ldt-proxy.js` — what it does

`GET <worker-url>?q=<term>&status=All|approved|conditionally_approved` →

```json
{
  "term": "CENP-B",
  "total": 1,
  "count": 1,
  "records": [
    {
      "facilityName": "Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute",
      "facilityId": "...", "projectId": "...", "facilityState": "...",
      "analyte": "...", "method": "...", "specimenType": "...",
      "permitCategory": "...", "status": "Approved",
      "detailLink": "https://www.wadsworth.org/node/.../printable/print"
    }
  ]
}
```

`total` is the true match count reported by the site (accurate even though only the first
50 records are returned — `records` is capped to keep response size/latency predictable,
since a bare 2-3 letter antigen abbreviation can otherwise match thousands of rows).

Notes for anyone modifying this:

- The upstream query always requests the antigen/analyte term as typed by the caller — the
  *client* (not this Worker) is responsible for stripping "Anti-"/Ig-class suffixes before
  calling it, since NY's site defaults to "contains any word" matching and words like "IgG"
  are present in a huge fraction of test names on their own.
- `items_per_page` must be one of the site's actual exposed-filter options (`5`, `10`, `20`,
  `25`, `50`, or `All`) — an arbitrary value like `100` silently breaks the filter server-side
  and the page renders as if nothing matched. This was found the hard way; don't "optimize"
  it back to a round number without re-checking against the real site.

## `fda-pdf-proxy.js` — what it does

`GET <worker-url>?k=<K number, e.g. K051061>` → the raw bytes of that device's 510(k)
**Decision Summary** PDF (`Content-Type: application/pdf`), or a JSON error if there isn't one
(HTTP 404) or something else went wrong.

This Worker deliberately does **not** parse the PDF — Cloudflare Workers have no built-in PDF
parser, and bundling one would require a build step this project avoids. It's a pure byte
relay. The tool extracts text from the returned PDF client-side using
[PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) (loaded from a CDN, same pattern as Chart.js/
SheetJS) and looks for the "Measurand:" field that FDA's standard IVD Decision Summary
template includes — this is a separate, more detailed document from the plain clearance
letter, and confirms what a device actually measures more authoritatively than matching
against its device name alone.

Notes for anyone modifying this:

- Not every 510(k) has a Decision Summary — coverage is good for modern IVD/clinical
  chemistry devices but far weaker (or absent) for older submissions (pre-2000s ones
  regularly 404).
- accessdata.fda.gov's bot detection blocks requests without a realistic browser
  `User-Agent` header (returns a small HTML "apology" page instead of the PDF) — the Worker
  already sets one; don't remove it.
- The "Measurand:" field is extracted with a regex against the plain-text layout FDA's
  template produces (`Measurand:` followed by the value, terminated by the next section,
  typically `Type of Test:`). This is reliable for the standard template but not guaranteed
  for every document format FDA has used over the decades.
